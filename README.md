# CMSC414 - Email Phishing Project

# School Purposes Only. Not intended for actual use.
The purpose of this project is to show the dangers of phishing through email. We created a website identical to the VCU Password Management website in which users input their username, email, old password, and new password. This confidential data is stored in a database, where we will be able to view it.
